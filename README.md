# hello-world
***
Working on my first project with github... Not sure where I'm going, but given time and familiarity, I'm hoping this will be useful in furthering my advancement with coding. ???

- 👋 Hi, I’m @EyeMagic

- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code more than just HTML & CSS

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to more thoroughly use Oxygen

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to further my experience and learning. I started my career in the printing industry (primarily 'pre-press'), and would offer 'trading' my graphic design experience to projects to further my learning code, etc.

- 📫 How to reach me ... I'm on Discord (EyeMagic#5753) and Slack, as well as 'Discussions' here.
